    "             - the color. I thought about changing it to a gradient colour and found more complex details on how to do it. But to keep it simple I didn't implement it (11). However as I wanted to change the colour to something more related to the dropping of a temperature I researched in Matplotlib and found a List of named colours, using 'lightsteelblue' for the first arrow and 'lightcoral' for the arrow showing increase in the temperature (12). Learned by observing the way the colors are presented in different slyles that while the parameter 'facecolor' changes just the filling of the arrow, keeping the border in the standard color (black), the parameter 'color' actually changes the filling and the border to the same color. So, for this activity I preferred to use the parameter 'color' instead. and to shrink the arrow's lenght by 5% so it does not touch the annotation. \n",
    "            -  I then used the property shrink to shorten the arrow's lenght so it does not touch the annotation text or the point.\n",
    "            'arrowprops=dict(color='lightsteelblue', shrink=0.05))'\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the second arrow showing the increase in the temperature, apart of changing the color to 'lightcoral', I also had to change the y positioning of the xytext to decrease 5 as I wanted to see the text under the arrow and not above. I used the iloc for x and y in the 79th value (starting from 0). Also in this point, I had to add the parameter horizontalalignment as the text was exploding outside the chart area (14). I did the same for the first arrow.\n",
