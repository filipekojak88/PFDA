*Programming for Data Analytics* [[1]](#1)  

## About this repository

This repository contains the assignments and project completed for the module of Programming for Data Analytics in ATU with the lecturer Andrew Beatty. 
In order to complete the assignments some Python programming skills were used such as data manipulation with **Pandas**, data visualization with **Matplotlib**, and working with Jupyter Notebooks, along with basic file handling, string operations, and logic for simulations.

This README has been written with [Github's documentation on README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) and [Wenger's article on 'Why having a Readme on your internal project is essential'](https://wengerk.medium.com/why-having-a-readme-on-your-internal-project-is-essential-c85cb9dd8e65) in mind [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3).     
MarkDown was used in this README file and was based on [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) [[4]](#4).

## Getting Started

Here you can see a brief description on how to navigate through this repository, which contains the completed assignments for the Programming for Data Analytics (PFDA) course:

### 1. Navigate the Repository  
Use the [PFDA repository](https://github.com/filipekojak88/PFDA) to access the assignment folders. 
For the several assignments completed to master PFDA skills you should access the folder `assignments`. But if you are more interested in the project Windspeed for Windfarms then you should access the folder `project`.

### 2. Run the Assignments Notebooks and Scripts
The `assignments` folder includes Jupyter Notebooks and other files used in the notebooks self or as part of the assignments request. These files use extensions such as `.jpeg`, `.txt` and `.csv` files. Below is a breakdown of each Jupyter Notebook:

#### **Assignment 2: Weather Plot**
- **File**: `assignment2-weather.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook plots the temperature over time using the `dryBulbTemperature_Celsius` column from a CSV file.
- **How to Run**: Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to generate a temperature plot.

#### **Assignment 3: Pie Chart of Email Domains**
- **File**: `assignment03-pie.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook generates a pie chart based on email domains extracted from a CSV file containing 1000 email addresses.
- **How to Run**: Open the notebook, and run the cells to generate the pie chart.

#### **Assignment 5: Risk Simulation**
- **File**: `assignment_5_risk.ipynb`
- **Description**: This script simulates 1000 battle rounds in the board game Risk, plotting the results of dice rolls and troop losses.
- **How to Run**: Open the notebook in Jupyter to simulate the battle rounds and visualize the results.

#### **Assignment 6: Knock Airport Weather Analysis**
- **File**: `assignment_6_Weather.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook analyzes weather data from Knock Airport, generating plots for temperature, wind speed, and rolling averages.
- **How to Run**: Open the notebook, and execute the cells to visualize the weather data.

### 3. Run the Project Notebook



## Use of This Repository

### Assignments

These assignments how to apply data analysis and simulation techniques using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and various libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It helps students build essential skills in handling and analyzing datasets, creating visualizations, and performing simulations such as weather analysis or game outcomes.

Some suggested applications:

- **Educational Value**: It provides a hands-on approach to learning data manipulation, visualization, and simulation. Students can use these assignments as a template to explore other data analysis tasks and enhance their programming abilities.
- **Real-World Insights**: By working with weather and simulation data, the assignments showcase how to analyze real-world datasets and make informed decisions, such as predicting trends, simulating outcomes, or exploring statistical patterns.

### Project



## Get Help

If you have any questions while exploring this project, feel free to reach out to me via GitHub. Iâ€™m happy to offer additional information. A complete list of references can be found at the end of this README file. The reference numbers throughout this `README.md` and the `weather.ipynb` files are clickable links that will take you directly to their corresponding sources in the reference section, offering more details on the concepts and methodologies used in this project.

## Contribute

These assingments and project represent the author's approach regards to data collection, analysis, and visualization using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Contributions are encouraged, especially those that improve the functionality, efficiency, or readability of the scripts, or introduce new features for analyzing different types of datasets.

The step-by-step structure applied in the activities allows others to replicate the process or adapt it to their own datasets, making it a valuable learning resource. The integration of interactive notebooks allows for easy customization and experimentation with various types of data analysis.

Contributions are particularly welcome in the following areas:
- Enhancing the visualizations or analytical methods.
- Improving the overall performance of the scripts.
- Adding new features to extend the functionality of the notebooks.

I used [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com) to generate the following clickable link.      
It opens the [assignment2-weather.ipynb](assignment2-weather.ipynb), [assignments/assignment03-pie.ipynb](assignments/assignment03-pie.ipynb), [assignment_5_risk.ipynb](assignment_5_risk.ipynb) and [assignment_6_Weather.ipynb](assignment_6_Weather.ipynb) notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) [[5]](#5).
